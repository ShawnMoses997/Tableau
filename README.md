This repository showcases examples of my work in Tableau, demonstrating my ability to create meaningful visualizations, dashboards, and insights using a variety of datasets. Feel free to explore, and let me know if you have any questions or feedback!

## Introduction
In this portfolio, you'll find a collection of Tableau projects that I have developed. Each project folder contains Tableau workbooks (.twbx), explanations of the visualizations, and where applicable, data files or links to the data sources. These projects highlight my skills in data analysis, visualization design, and storytelling through data.
